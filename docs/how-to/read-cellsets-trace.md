# Read the trace of a cell in a CellSet

!!! note "Assumptions"
    This section assumes you: 

    1. have the API installed, 
    2. have imported it using `import isx` 
    3. have a ISXD CellSet accessible on your local file system at `cellset.isxd`




Once a cell set is opened using:


```python
cell_set = isx.CellSet.read("cellset.isxd")
```
we can read the trace of any cell using:

```python
cell_trace = cell_set.get_cell_trace(n)
```

where `n` is <= the [number of cells](read-cellsets-num-cells.html) in the cell set. 

`cell_trace` now contains a [numpy array](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html) with the trace data for the first frame. 

!!! warning "Indexing"
    Note that python indexes by 0, so the first frame is at index 0, and the the second frame is at index 1, and so on.
